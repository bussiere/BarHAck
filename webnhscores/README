This program reads the nethack records file and publishes an html page on the
server.

SAMPLE:

To see the output of a running version of this program, take a look here:

    http://games.libreplanet.org/nethack

INSTALL:

First you need to install python-daemon. There may be a package for this in
your package manager. If not, install python-pip and run this:

    sudo pip install daemon

I suggest that you put a copy of the program in /usr/local/bin . Then copy the
inits/webnhscores file into /etc/init.d/ if you use init scripts on your
system. If you use systemd, then copy the inits/webnhscores file into
/usr/lib/systemd/system/

CONFIGURING (Important)

To change the behavior of the program, copy the webnhscores.cfg.sample file to
/etc/webnhsores.cfg, and change the settings in that file. alternatively, you
can launch the program with -c option, to specify a local config file. (see the
--help option.)

RUNNING

To start, using init scripts, run the following:

    sudo service start webnhscores
    ps -ef | grep webnhscores

The program should start after reboot.

To start, using systemd, run:

    sudo systemctl webnhscores start
    systemctl status webnhscores

To make the program start after sytem boot, run:

    sudo systemctl enable webnhscores

If you don't want to use systemd or init, then you can just run plain old:

    sudo su -l games -c webnhscores

You also have the option to run it without admin access, if you set the html
output file to somewhere in your home folder:

    /path/to/program/webnhscores

STOPPING

To stop the daemon, send it a SIGINT.

    kill -s SIGINT $PID_OF_DAEMON
